Maya Plug-in Wizard 2.0
=======================

The Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0 version of the Maya plug-in wizard for this release is contained in the MayaPluginWizard2.0.zip file.  This wizard is HTML based and contains several files and folders that must be copied into the Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0 install.

1. Unzip the MayaPluginWizard2.0.zip file.

2. Copy the following files to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\vcprojects" folder:

	MayaPluginWizard.vsdir
	MayaPluginWizard.vsz
	MayaPluginWizard.ico

3. Copy the top-level "MayaPluginWizard" folder to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\VCWizards".  NOTE: there should be a MayaPluginWizard folder within a MayaPluginWizard folder after this step.

To use the wizard, do the following:

1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0 and invoke File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ Projects and select MayaPluginWizard.

2. Enter a name and solution name and select the OK button.

3. Fill in the information for the "Plug-in setup" screen and then select the "Plug-in type" and "Included libraries" links to also enter the required information.

4. The project will be created and can be modified as desired then built using the "Build" menu.

NOTE: 
- If you are working with an non-english installation of Microsoft Visual Studio, then you may have to alter the folders that the files are copied into above.
